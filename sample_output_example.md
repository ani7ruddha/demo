## Body Copy Frameworks

### Problem-Agitate-Solution
**Target Awareness:** problem_aware

**Example:**
"Working 60 hours a week, when am I supposed to cook?"

Sound familiar? Every diet expert tells you to meal prep on Sundays, hit the gym 5 times a week, and track every calorie. But you barely have time to sleep, let alone spend 3 hours chopping vegetables.

That's why we created the 15-Minute Weight Loss System - designed for people who actually work for a living. No meal prep. No gym membership. Just real results that fit into your real life.

### Before-After-Bridge
**Target Awareness:** solution_aware

**Example:**
**Before:** You're ordering takeout again because you're too exhausted to cook. The weight keeps creeping up, and you feel stuck in a cycle of failed diets.

**After:** Imagine losing 20 pounds without spending hours in the kitchen or gym. You have energy again, your clothes fit better, and you finally found something that works with your schedule.

**Bridge:** Our proven system takes just 15 minutes a day and works around your busy life - not against it.

## Objection Handlers

**Objection:** "I've tried everything and nothing works"
**Response:** We hear this all the time. That's because every other program was designed for people with unlimited time. This is the first system built specifically for busy professionals who work 60+ hours a week. It's not another diet - it's a completely different approach.

**Objection:** "I don't have time for this"
**Response:** That's exactly why we created this. If you have 15 minutes a day, you have enough time. No meal prep, no long workouts, no complicated tracking.

**Objection:** "How is this different from [other program]?"
**Response:** Unlike programs that require hours of meal prep and gym time, our system was reverse-engineered from the habits of busy professionals who successfully lost weight while working 60+ hours. It's designed for your life, not someone else's.
